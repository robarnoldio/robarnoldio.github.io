<p>This page aims to collect the details about some of the remarkable things I work on. Along with the remarks that make the things remarkable.</p>

<p>Right now, I'm trying to learn quite a bit about python by means of constructing projects using the Raspberry Pi. Luckily, I have a good background for this, having worked with breadboards (hardware) and code (software) previously in engineering school. That was 20 years ago however, and my hope is to stay current with the things today's makers use to craft their wonderful projects.</p>

<p>And Github itself is one of those things that makes today so much better than 20 years ago, so I'm here to learn and get proficient with that too. And I hope that walking through some of my work will help others with similar interests. </p>

<p>Currently I'm focused on coding more functions for my short program that vrites to a vaccuum fluorescent display (VFD).That is <a href="https://github.com/robarnoldio/VFD-RPi"here</a>.</p>
